    <h1>About US</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Retro Game Store, your number one source for all retro games. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of gaming, with a focus on nostalgia, customer service and uniqueness.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2019 by Brandon LaDuke, Bruce Durham, Ekaterina Hillary and Eric Taylor, Retro Game Store has a bright future. The founders goal is to bring the memories of times spent in youth playing these games to customers. Understanding that  customers cannot find these relics easily, opening an online store will help customers not only relive their childhood by being able to find their beloved games, but also help pass these relics on to other generations by being able to sell games.</p>
    <p>We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
    <p class="closing">Sincerely,<br>
      Brandon, Bruce, Ekaterina and Eric</p>
