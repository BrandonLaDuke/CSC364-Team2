# Directions
The group project consists of two components: A practical system component and a written user manual.

1. The written component (user manual) is a typical user documentation of how your system works.
2. For the practical component, your project team develops a small business system, local computer based or online.  

## Practical Component or System Guidelines
The system can be a small business database application such as for a Bookstore, Horse Farm, Ladies Boutique Store or a small business website. 

- The application can be a local computer installed system written in Access DB or any other language such as VB or C++. It also can be an online website or application developed in .NET, C#, Php-mySQL or an e-commerce site in a free domain offered by WIX.COM or in a similar platform. You can use your own web hosting also.
- The system or website should look professional, be user friendly, and contain all necessary information needed for a successful system. The URL of the website should be inserted in the written document under a heading named Practical Component: System Design.
- These are systems topics you can decide in teams and gain approval from your instructor.
- Discuss with your instructor in what format (.MDB, .exe, Bin or an URL) the system can be presented for final evaluation.
- Last but not least, this is an academic project. Try to select a simple project without too much complicated logic and layout to complete the project in time.

The objectives of the group project are to encourage team building and to ensure you have learned the basic and advanced concepts introduced in the course, and you are able to analyze and synthesize the principles of systems analysis and design. The group project allows for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 members in each group (changes are at the discretion of the instructor).

Your instructor designates the teams/groups of 2-4 students by the end of Week 2.

## User Manual Guidelines

The user manual should include the following:

- Background and evolution or need for the system in the business.
- Potential impact of the system on the business operations to make it more efficient.
- Steps on how to navigate through the system.
- Explanation of all menu or navigation choices the user has to learn to operate the system or site.
- Graphics and screen shots of the pages (screens) as typically you can find in a systems manual.
- The manual should be in HTML or PDF format.
- This is an example of a user manual.

## Important System Project Milestones

- *Week 3:* Form groups and choose a leader. The leader submits the topic for approval. All communication about the project must come from the team leader. Please do not submit multiple documents of the project from different members. That becomes rather confusing for the instructor.
- *Week 5:* Project Outline due.
- *Week 8:* Draft submitted by group leader for feedback. Project and systems manual draft should contain about 90% of the final project contents and functionalities.
- *Week 10:* Final project due.
