## ASSIGNMENT Week 3
The deliverable this week, pick a leader - submit a 1 page document for your teams proposed topic. This can be any pitch - ideally something most of your team is interested in. Remember - keep the scope small - groups that do well have just a few pages (web, phone app, ...) and show a detailed flow/logic.
